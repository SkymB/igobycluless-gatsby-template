Second week, completed. âœ…

This idea of a tree/sea/space cross breed has been playing around in my head for a  while now. Hopefully it came out good. The one thing I am proud of is the sea. In my last post I promised I'd try to make a more realistic sea and I'd like to think I did just that. 

What I'll like to improve on would be the tree leaves. I'll try to do that in a later post. 

The roots at the bottom were originally supposed to be a rose but I decided to forgo that venture. I'll make a separate post for a rose later next month as well. 

I can't believe it's almost September already. Felt like it was February just the other day. 

Anyways, that's it for me. Signing out,
