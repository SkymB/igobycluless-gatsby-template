This is a bit different from my usual posts, I was contemplating whether to even make an entry about this but the entire point of this blog is to document my process, right?

So here it is; I really don't like this. 

I was trying to go for the same vibe I did in my "Stare" entry but, alas, the prerequisite vibes were off.

I hate the bushes, they look fake- like paper. It wasn't the look I was going for at all. I suspect it had to do with how I added the highlights to them but I just couldn't figure out how to fix it.

Also, note that these were the second set of bushes I did because the first set looked so god-awful that I had to redo them. I was trying to get the same look that I had for my üå≥ in "Stare". I was trying to do this because I promised myself that I would try to stick to the more cartoony look that I had accomplished there but I just could not reciprocate it in this scene. 

The light streaming in was also off, I just couldn't get it how I wanted it. I (somewhat) liked the wood over the rocks because I was able to give it that 3D kinda look, it took way too many layers to accomplish. The rocks were hard to achieve but I like them.

The bird isn't my favourite. In an earlier version, it looked like it was part egg ü•≤, I tried my best to add some kind of texture. You know it's bad when the feather came out better than the bird. 

I'm not a fan of the trees, I always struggle with trees. I am unsure as to why. It's either a hit or miss. This was a miss, they also looked like paper.

The eyes and the fireflies never seem to fail me which I am very thankful for. The cool moss on the ground was something I had done by accident. There's a stamp on Krita for ground details, I accidentally had the colour green instead of dark brown and that's how this happy accident occurred.

This took me over 5 hours to do. I'm not exactly mad or disappointed because I redid this entire scene in under 5 hours using a completely new brush and I love the new version so much.üòä

What I do like about this was that it was a teaching moment. I'm glad I was able to finish it early because I may not have been able to redo it in time for Saturday. I don't like it but I think it was necessary.

Thanks for reading this far. See you Saturday and enjoy until then!
