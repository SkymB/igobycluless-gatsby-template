Remember when I promised to make a separate post for a rose? I failed. 

Miserably.

This was supposed to be *that* post. Ever since I said I was going to do it, this image came to mind. Unfortuantely, the realistic rose I wanted to do I just don't have the skills for.

So, I'll try that later. When I'm (hopefully) better.

What I **do** love about this picture, however, is the cat. I absolutely adore it. The background is also nice and I like how well it all came together.

In other news, school literally starts for me tomorrow.

Which sucks.

I still want to keep the weekly posts coming, though, I will try my best!

I'm going into my second year so I'm hoping that I will learn from my first-year mistakes. If any of you are now going into university, remember this. The first week can make or break your semester. It's a deceptive little shit that makes you think you have everything under control.

But then you blink and it's midterms and you have 5 topics from all of your courses to study for in two weeks (if you're lucky enough).

Don't fall for the first week trap!

Anyways, that's it for me. Signing out,
