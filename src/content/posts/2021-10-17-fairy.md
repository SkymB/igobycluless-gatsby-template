This picture was originally supposed to be a Pegasus (a horse with wings) but drawing the horse digitally was somehow more difficult than a traditional sketch so I gave up.

Yes, that is how I'm starting off today's entry. How is everyone doing? Hope you all had a good week.üòä

I'm trying to get the hang of making clouds. For my last piece, [Snowland](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/snowland), I really liked how the clouds came out. I had used the "old used brush" from [David Revoy's Krita Brushkit v8.2](https://www.davidrevoy.com/article319/krita-brushkit-v8), added a layer filled with grey above the one with the clouds and had that filter set to "burn". For this piece, I re-used the same grey-layer idea but used the "multiply" filter instead to darken it. I used the blend tool to somewhat smoothen out the cloud edges but not too much so I could maintain the texture that was (miraculously) created.

For the mountains, I used a stamp that comes with Krita's basic bundle... Next time I'll try to make my own. Not really loving how it looks here. The grass was also created by using a stamp.

For my next piece, I'm going to try a new style for my art... I'm not sure if it'll be any good or not but I am definitely looking forward to it ü§©. Wish me luck!!

Anyways, that's it for me. Signing out,
