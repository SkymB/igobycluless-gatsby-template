**Disclaimer**: I am no art master, critic or expert. Take everything I say here with a grain of salt, I am only talking about how this method has worked for **me**.

Now that that's out of the way, hi, how are you? :D

For those of you who don't know, the Grayscale Method is when you paint your piece in greyscale first and then use the varying blend/layer modes (depending on what software you use, the name may vary) to add the colour over that layer.

This way you can focus more on the values (the light and dark of a certain shade of colour, I think) overall before getting into the details of the piece.

Now, I know absolutely nothing, all of these fancy words are what I've found online :D. For me personally who knows nothing about "structure" and very little about colour theory \*insert more fancy terminology here\*, just having to paint in black and white and focus on the shadows is actually way easier on me.

I've been enjoying it a lot actually. It's pretty fun. The pictures above are when I've used this method and if you compare that to [Clouds](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/clouds), there is a clear difference. 

What I've found though, is that with the greyscale method, since you have to use all of the different layer modes (that I'm not entirely sure how they work), it's much more difficult to colour pick when it comes to that point.

The tutorial I had first seen had said to use the "Colour" mode which worked fine until it came to doing the skin. I couldn't figure out how to get the shade I wanted but when I switched to "Multiply" it worked out. I'm sure this will become easier the more I practice and the more I understand how these modes work.

That's about it for me, this wasn't going to be my original post but what I had planned does not look the best right now so I figured, I could talk about this in the meantime.

I hope you enjoyed it,
