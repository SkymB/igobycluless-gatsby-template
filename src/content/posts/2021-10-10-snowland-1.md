Remember when I said that eventually, I would come to dislike the "[Excalibur](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/excalibur)" piece after a while? That time has come. Apparently, I have to work on my perspective. The shrub behind the sword is a hedge... but a lot of persons thought it was a hill.

That really bummed me out but these things happen. Next time, I'll do better.

Now! I really like this piece. Mountains have been the bane of my existence for a long time and I think I may finally be getting the hang of them. I did so many reiterations of those two above ‚òùüèΩ that I've lost count. I think the final product is the best version.

I also adore the clouds. I've been struggling with those too and I'm extremely pleased with how they came out.

Even though I am saying all of these, I know I can do better. I've recently started trying to sketch daily. I wasn't able to every day this week but I'm hoping that in the future, I would at least be able to sketch more and more.

It's a lot more entertaining than I thought it would have been. üòä

It is very therapeutic!

What I would like to improve on would be the silhouette. Right now, for my digital art, I'm trying to focus on environment scenes. I'm also trying to find the right style for me. Basically, actual humans are difficult for me to draw right now but I would love to be able to at least do a silhouette.

I hope all of you (invisible people who read this blog) are doing well. Feel free to shoot me a message [here](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/contact) or to DM me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/igobycluless/). You can also check my sketches there if you're interested.

Anyways, that's it for me. Signing out,
