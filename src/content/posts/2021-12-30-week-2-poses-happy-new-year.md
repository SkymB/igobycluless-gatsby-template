It's almost 2022 😱. The year felt like it flew by so fast yet crawled at the same time. It's also hard to believe that I'm only four months into this art journey of mine. 

It feels like it's been longer.

I just want to say thank you for the support 🤗.

**What I Like:**

This week I focused on sitting poses, as well as style experimentation. The references for these were something found on Pinterest ([click here](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/296815431700923767/)) from another artist. I tried to focus on understanding the overall shapes of the bodies in these positions (I think I did pretty ok). 

In terms of style, I like the one on the right more. I'm a sucker for cute things, I cannot lie.🤭 

**What I want to improve:**

Hands.

The bane of my existence.

Also clothing. Right now I think I'm doing a decent enough job but I would like to do better. Since I'm focusing on poses/anatomy right now, it will just have to sit on the back burner but it will definitely be a focus later on. 

I enjoy doing these a lot 😊 and I definitely feel like I'm getting better. I think that's about it for me. This will be my last post for the year so early Happy New Years everyone!! Stay safe and enjoy!
