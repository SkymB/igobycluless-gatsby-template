For the past month (I think) I've been doing a [Udemy course on Krita](https://www.udemy.com/course/krita-basic-to-advanced-digital-painting/) (don't worry I got it while it was discounted). It's supposed to help you with the absolute basics of the application itself and as the course progresses you go more in-depth into skills necessary for graphical art.

The skull above is an assignment we had to do. It was not at all what I had planned to post today but in all honestly, it's the only thing I have.

This week has been somewhat hectic; in two week's time I have 3 assignments due, it's really starting to feel like I'm at University again.

However! Back to the more important topic, I am **really** proud of this skull. During this assignment, I learned about the fundamentals of shading and highlighting. My skull look's nothing like the instructor's and honestly, I think that's what's so great about it.

His was more 3D than mine (and angrier), for sure, but I really liked the way mine came out overall. I also think from now on, in terms of my "style" (or lack thereof) I will try to get a good balance of 2D cartoon-ish art and 2D-realistic art.

My main focus right now are environmental and abstract pieces, anyway, because I'm not ready to venture into human portraits just yet.

What are your thoughts? You can DM me/comment under my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/igobycluless/) post (that will be posted tomorrow) or you can directly contact me [here](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/contact).

Anyways, that's it for me. Signing out,
