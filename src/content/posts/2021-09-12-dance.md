We've reached 4 weeks of consistent uploads! Love that for us.

This is not what I at all intended to draw but it's what came about. I think it turned out pretty ok. I always wanted to do something pertaining to chess as I've recently gotten into it and hope to play more of it. 

The silhouette took way longer than I'm proud to say but it was an interesting experience. From the moment I drew it, I knew I wanted a dark background and I think I delivered on that. I kinda used this opportunity to mess around with the different brush presets on Krita. 

I also made a watermark.

That also took way longer than I care to disclose but it's ok for now.

So what I like the most about this entire thing is the silhouette. Hopefully, in the future, I can draw a more realistic queen and even a chessboard.

School starting back has hampered the amount of time I can spend drawing. The first week hasn't been **too** bad but, like I said in my previous post; the first week is deceptive in nature.

I still plan to at least post once a week on Sundays, as I promised. 

If you want to see the other colours of the silhouette I made, check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/igobycluless/).

Anyways, that's it for me. Signing out,
