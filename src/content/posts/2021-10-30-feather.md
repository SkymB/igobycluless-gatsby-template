Hope everyone is doing well! I have to make this quick since I have to start working on an assignment for school.üíî

So this is the revamped version of the previous post I made! You can see the first version [here](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/some-thoughts). I am really enjoying this style. So much. I was struggling with the one I did for "[Stare](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/stare)" like I said before. I'm finding this style way easier and to my liking. That's not to say that I don't like "Stare" anymore, because I absolutely do, I just don't think the style is flexible enough. 

The brush I used was "Ink-7_Brush_Rough". I'm pretty sure it's a standard brush from Krita. It's really fun to use, I honestly am enjoying it a lot.

**What I like:**

I am finally loving how my trees are coming out! Drawing the little lines was really fun to do. I also like the bushes, since they look like... bushes. The last time I did trees behind a bush for a piece was with Excalibur and some persons thought it was trees on a hill. 

**What I want to improve:**

Definitely the bird. I don't hate it and I am 100% sure that it looks better than the bird I did for the first version, I just need more practice with animals in general. I think it looks cute, I just know I can do better. 

Differently, I'm using a different signature. Adding random "c's" is really fun to do!üòÇ I think I'll stick with this going forward.

That's about it for me! Signing out,
