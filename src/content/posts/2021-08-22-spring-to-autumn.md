My *first* upload.

Not gonna lie; I'm nervous. This piece was basically for me to figure out how a graphics tablet works as I've never had one before. It was also for me to dip my toes in the proverbial "art pool"; a necessity on my journey to becoming at least half-way decent in digital art.

I've done digital artwork before, but I would like to count this as my first and unfortunately, I find it a bit plain.

The one thing I am proud of is the grass. If you follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/igobycluless/), you would've seen my story about how I was not aware of how difficult it was to draw grass.

Side note: I told my S/O that and they thought I meant "grass" as weed.

The one thing I would like to improve would be the water. Right now, I have no idea how to make it more realistic; maybe I'll try to do that for my next project.

Anyways, that's it for me. Signing out,
