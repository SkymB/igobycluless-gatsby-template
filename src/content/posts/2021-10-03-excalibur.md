Another week, another piece completed.‚úÖ

How's your week been? I hope it's been better than mine. School's been a bitch recently, I barely finished this in time. 

Honestly, art and my partner has been what's keeping me sane. I was really looking forward to in-person classes this semester but a lot of  COVID cases started rolling in when school was about to start, so my university opted for all online classes. So there went my hopes and dreams...

Anyways, enough about me! Let's get to analyzing.

Not to toot my own horn or anything but I think this is the best one yet! In a year... or a couple of months... or days, I'll hate it, but for now, I adore this so much.ü§©

I was able to use what I learnt in my class in this piece; that's what I am most proud about. The rock is my favourite part of the entire thing. My second favourite are the trees. I changed them so much before I got to this current state, it's unbelievable. I just didn't want a redo of the [Cherry Blossoms ](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/cherry-blossoms)tree because I hated that tree. 

Which sucked because it was the main focus.

But I digress.

For the leaves, I used a stamp on Krita. If I knew there was a stamp earlier I would've used it much soonerüòë but you live and you learn. 

For the spotlight, I first darkened the overall image by making a new layer filled with a transparent grey. I then changed the layer filter to "multiply" so it could be even darker (but not too dark). Adding a layer above that, I outlined a triangular-like shape over the rock and filled it in with a much lighter colour. The filter over this layer was "lighten". For the smaller triangles on the spotlight, I outlined those and then used the colour-doge brush on Krita. 

Using the blend tool, I blended out the base and top of the light so it wouldn't look so jagged. I left the smaller triangles the same because, well, they looked cool.

I think this is the longest I've ever written.

What I want to improve on is the detailing of the sword and the trees. Even though I like them, I want the bark to look more realistic. I think I got the colour right but the sharpness isn't good at all.

I also want to improve the hedge/bush. I also did so many iterations and this is what I liked the best.

Anyways, that's it for me. Signing out,
