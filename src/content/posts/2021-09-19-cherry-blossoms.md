I'm posting a bit early, I know [üòÖ](https://emojipedia.org/grinning-face-with-sweat/). Going forward I may decide to post on Saturday nights so that it's not such a rush to post to both my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/igobycluless/) and [here](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/blog) as well.

Differently, I hope all is well with you. My week has been a little hectic. I recently signed up to be a Peer-Mentor of sorts at my University. So that's (unfortunately) been an added workload to manage.

So far, so good, though. I just hope I can help my Mentees a little. I'll try my best to help them so they don't suffer through their first year as I did.

Enough of that, however, on to the topic at hand! The picture:

Objectively? Not my best. 

I had some issues trying to make the blossoms look life-like and as if they were "flowing in the breeze". I think I ended up with a whimsical" look which isn't that bad in my humble opinion.

What I am most proud of is the grass (throw back to my first [post](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/spring-to-autumn) where I said that). I remember promising to make some more realistic leaves in the future. 

I tried, I really did. 

I don't think I fully captured what I was going for but it's definitely a step up from what I had done before in my ["Majesty"](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/majesty) post.

I also messed around with the different settings for the layers. The layer setting I went with was "Colour Dodge" on Krita. I also did one with "Luminosity" which I'll post to Instagram. 

What I would like to improve on would be, again, the leaves. I think I did a good job on the overall details of this artwork, though. 

According to my partner the picture is cute. So cute, to the point that it looks like a really talented seven-year-old drew it.[üòë](https://emojipedia.org/expressionless-face/)

I'll get better, I  promise.

Anyways, that's it for me. Signing out,
