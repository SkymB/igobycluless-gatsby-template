Hi everyone, I hope you are all doing well. Firstly I would like to say a few things before we start. "[Stare](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/stare)", "[Feather](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/feather)" and "[Path](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/path)" were all originally supposed to be a part of a series. Hence the spooky eyes appear in them. Unfortunately... I just didn't feel like I could finish it the way I wanted to. I've decided to revisit the idea again sometime next year.

Secondly, this is the first time Neo is being featured here and she's appearing so many timesüòÖ.

Thirdly, I'm doing something a bit different this week. The picture above is how many times I re-visited this piece to make some edits. So I'll be discussing my thought process behind why I decided to do certain things and what I learned from this entire process. I'll try to blast through these as fast as possible.

1) The original version. I wanted to practice my clouds and ended up including Neo because... why not?

2) I didn't like how the original hair turned out so I tried making it so that it gave the impression of falling? I (hope) I captured that ok. I also added some flowers to fill up the space because it felt a bit empty. I also moved her ears down, her face looked so strange to me for the longest time and I could not figure out why. It was because her ears were in line with her eyes. 

3) I didn't like the flowers. I also moved her right arm further inward, it felt a bit off to me and too long in that angle. I also added the glow to her eyes and redid the grass. As a result of the glow, I darkened the shadows on her nose, eyelids and ears. You can also see I redid the cloud as the original wasn't what I was going for. I also changed the direction of the hair details on the top of her head to give it a more uniform look. Also fixed her chin and put it into the centre of her face (as it should be).

4) Changed how the light source behind the cloud was and tried to make the cloud less blurry.

5) Redid the grass (again) as I didn't like how blurry it was throughout the progression. I also tried to put the cloud into even more focus. I also added slight blush to her cheeks, something I've never done before. 

**What I learned:**

I needed to cut myself off at one point otherwise I would've kept on going over this without stopping. I also learned that going over my pieces once or twice does help in the long run. I've also been trying to find other artists that I can learn from since I'm so new to the community and stumbled upon [Ethan Becker](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthanBecker70) (click his name, his videos are greatüòÅ). For this piece, I actually took my own reference photos because I couldn't find any with someone looking down at something in this angle. I honestly only did that because of Ethan so I'm grateful and looking forward to learning a lot more. üòä

Anyways that's it for me. I hope you enjoyed the change-up,
