How is everyone? This week has been a bit harsh on me but as promised, here is my new piece with a new style!ü§©

I enjoyed drawing this so muchüòÜ. I've been enjoying drawing (both digitally and traditionally) more than I ever have lately. Before, art was something that I just wanted to be decent at but the more I do it the more I seem to find myself loving the process.

There were so many revisions of this piece before I settled on what I really liked the most. Overall, I am really proud of it and I don't think I'll grow to eventually hate it (hopefully). I like it even more than my [Excalibur](https://igobycluless.netlify.app/excalibur) piece.

I've been trying to find my "style" and I don't think it'll come easily but what I do know is that I really like this art style a lot. In my mind, I've always wanted to be a semi-realistic artist who focused on environmental/scenery scenes. I still want to focus on the environment but I also enjoy doing stylized art more than realistic art. Maybe in the future, I'll attempt to do semi-realistic pieces again but for now, I will see where this style takes me. 

**What I Like:**

The eyes. I've been told they look creepy, I find them very adorableü•∫. I also adore the fireflies. I created them by adding a grey, transparent layer over everything and used the "multiply" filter to darken the overall effect. I then made some small, yellow-ish circles and used the blur filter over them. After, I used the "4f Adjust Dodge" from [David Revoy's Krita Brushkit v8.2](https://www.davidrevoy.com/article319/krita-brushkit-v8) for the light effect on the surrounding areas. 

**What I want to improve:**

Surprisingly, the grass. Before in all of my pieces, I've always liked how my grass came out but because this is the first time I'm outlining what I'm drawing, I find it difficult to attain the same effect with my grass. I have faith that I'll figure it out eventually, though, so I'm not all of that worried. I would also like to improve my clouds even though I think they fit this image very well. I know that both of these can't be seen very well in the nighttime version, but I have a daytime version that I will also be posting to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/igobycluless/) tomorrow. 

I'm really looking forward to the next piece that I'll make in this style. I already have an idea and posted the rough sketch of it yesterday. Can't wait to see how it turns out. Wish me luck!!

Anyways, that's it for me. Signing out,
