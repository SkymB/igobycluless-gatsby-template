Here's another unplanned, random entry to take note of my journey. I think this may be the last of this kind, however. I'm not going to make it a habit to post my sketches on here but I wanted to commemorate this moment. 

Here is my first ever portrait study. I'm trying to... for lack of a better word, mess around with art. I'm coming to learn that nothing is set in stone and especially because I'm now starting, it may be best to try everything before settling on what I like.😁

The reason why I'm doing them is also because I would like to understand the human body better. This isn't the best realistic drawing but that's ok. I'm learning and that's what matters. It came out better than expected, that much I can say. I also have to get accustomed to not having an undo button so that's also a challenge.😅

I realized that I was trying to keep a certain theme for my IG page but I don't want that to hinder my actual progress. When I get better, then I'll focus on my IG looking (somewhat) cohesive but for now, I think it's ok if it's a little chaotic. 

Going to keep this short and sweet, that's about it for me. Hope everyone has a good week!
