Hi everyone! So sorry this post is so late. School happened (unfortunately). Hope you at least had a good week üíô. Jumping straight into it:

**What I like:**

The aim of this piece was colour. I want to use more colour in my pieces... I think I got that. Personally, I think this came out better than the "ungolden" version. It gave my trees a more... 3D-ish look? I used the airbrush to do it. I think it looks cool but I'm not sure if I will use it again in the future. 

**What I want to improve:**

So the reason why she's in black is because she looked horrible in colour so I kind of gave up and settled on a silhouette insteadüòÖ. I also want to work on the perspective. So it's clear (to me at least) that she's walking on a path in the forest but honestly, I'm not exactly sure how tall she is...? The foliage at the bottom was supposed to be grass but it kind of looks like bushes in comparison to her height. And because of that either the first row of trees are either really small or she is really tall. Or maybe I'm thinking too deeply about it, I'm not sure yet. 

My week was somewhat rough. I had a 2500 word essay and I started late but luckily, I finished in time. What was great about my week was that I drew Neo again but in a different style. You can see that [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWMvWtnrrVg/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). Right now... I am very proud of it. I'm also still proud of the original Neo. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing because I sometimes dislike my art a couple of hours after I do it. But that means growth, right? ü§î

Anyways that's it for me,
