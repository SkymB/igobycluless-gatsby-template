How's everyone doing? I'm finally on vacation ü•≥. 

This week, artistically speaking, has not been the best for me. I'm not sure why, but everything I started just was not satisfying me so I've finished nothing. These are actually some sketches I did either last week or 2 weeks ago (I can't remember). 

I found some references on Pinterest and tried my hand at poses and anatomy. They turned out ok, in my opinion, for someone who knows nothing but whenever I try to do poses for characters it doesn't work out and I'm not sure why. 

So I'm deciding to take a step back.

For... however long I think is necessary, I will try my best to focus mainly on anatomy and (slight) shading for the next few weeks. So my (IG) page and here will look a little colourless. I suspect I may lose some followers but that's ok. I'm learning and hopefully, after this period I'll be better. 

I'm realizing that I compare myself to other artists (not in a healthy way) although I did try to learn from them but whenever I used their work as a reference, it wouldn't work out. 

For now, I'll take a step back and focus mainly on one thing. I get the feeling that I'm trying to focus on too many things at once and that's also affecting my art.

I'll focus on one thing, get better and focus on something else. Wish me luck! :D 

I hope you enjoyed it,
